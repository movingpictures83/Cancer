Pre-processed cancer microbiome data generated and analysed in this study (that is, summarized read counts at the genus taxonomic level) as well as the metadata are available at ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/cancer_microbiome_analysis/. Raw outputs of Kraken- or SHOGUN-processed TCGA sequencing data comprise hundreds of terabytes of files and are not directly available unless otherwise coordinated with the corresponding author. However, all raw TCGA data and the bioinformatics pipeline necessary to generate such raw outputs from Kraken can be accessed through SevenBridgeâ€™s CGC. Each of the hundreds of ML models in this work generated a list of ranked features used to make predictions, and we provide the code to generate these lists, in addition to showing them on our website. Raw data for the plasma validation study are available through the European Nucleotide Archive (accession IDs ERP119598 (HIV-free); ERP119596 (PC); ERP119597 (LC and SKCM)); these data and the SHOGUN-processed data for the plasma validation study are available in Qiita (https://qiita.ucsd.edu/)79 under study IDs (12667 (HIV-free); 12691 (PC); 12692 (LC and SKCM)).
